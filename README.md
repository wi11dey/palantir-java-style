# Palantir Java Style

Indentation style style which matches [palantir-java-format](https://github.com/palantir/palantir-java-format) very closely. It won't rewrap but it will keep Java code indented the same.

## Usage

After loading the library, you can switch to the style for any Java file with <kbd>C-c</kbd> <kbd>.</kbd> `palantir`. See [Choosing a Style](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ccmode/Choosing-a-Style.html) to make it the default style.
